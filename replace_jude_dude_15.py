# Challenge: Replace jude with dude in an array
# Create a function called replace_array_jude_dude that replaces all occurances of 
# "jude" in array with "dude".
#
# Hint: It might be easy to get confused and think that this is about replacing
# occurances of a substring in a string. That's NOT what this challenges is
# about. Instead, the end result should be an array that is almost the same as 
#, except that all occurances of "jude" are "dude". Look closely at the tests.


def replace_array_jude_dude(the_array):
  output = []
  return output
    

assert(replace_array_jude_dude(['a', 'b', 'jude']) == ['a', 'b', 'dude'])
assert(replace_array_jude_dude(['jordann', 'jude', 'amie']) == ['jordann', 'dude', 'amie'])
