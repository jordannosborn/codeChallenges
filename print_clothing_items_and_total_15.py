# Challenge: Print clothing items and total
# Create a function called print_clothing_items_and_total that accepts a 
# dictionary of clothing items, prints each item in the dictionary and
# then the total cost of all items at the end.
#
# HINT: This will probably require two print statements: One in the loop
# and one at the end after the loop is done.


def print_clothing_items_and_total(clothing):
  print(0)


# Test:

# Assuming a dictionary like this:

# {'crop-top': 20, 'jeans': 130, 'leather-shoes': 200}

# The function should print this:

# crop-top
# jeans
# leather-shoes
# 350

print_clothing_items_and_total({'crop-top': 20, 'jeans': 130, 'leather-shoes': 200})
