# Challenge: Print One to num times two
# Create a function called print_one_to_num_times_two that accepts the
# parameter num, and prints each number from 1 to num multiplied by two.
# HINT: Don't forget that range needs 1 added to it in order to work 
# as expected.
# HINT: This is a print challenge, so you don't need to return anything.


def print_one_to_num_times_two(num):
  print(0)


# If num is 3, the output should look exactly like this:
#
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6

print_one_to_num_times_two(3)
