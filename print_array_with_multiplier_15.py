# Challenge: Print array with multiplier
# Create a function called print_array_with_multiplier that prints each element
# of an array of integers and multiplies it by a given integer.
# 
# Note that print_array_with_multiplier has two parameters: One is the array,
# the other is the number to multiply by.


def print_array_with_multiplier(the_array, mult):
  print(0)
    

# Assuming an array like this:

# [3, 4, 10]

# ...and a multiplier of 5, the function should print this:

# 15
# 20
# 50

print_array_with_multiplier([3, 4, 10], 5)
